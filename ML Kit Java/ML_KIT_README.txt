Included in this folder are some of the materials from trying to get the project working with the ML Kit.
This included open source ML Kit projects from Google, some ML Kit specific Java files,
as well as some code on TensorFlow that attempted to get the machine learning portion working.

Ultimitely, as we discussed in our presentation on December 7th, we moved our focus on the 
project to the AR Core as to get a Minimum Viable Product that we could present. This can be
seen in the "NewDemo" folder of the GitHub repository.
